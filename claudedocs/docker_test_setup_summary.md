# TimeTracker Docker Test Environment Setup - Summary

## Successfully Completed

### ✅ Dependencies Installation
- **Composer dependencies**: Successfully installed via `docker compose exec app composer install`
- **NPM dependencies**: Successfully installed via `docker compose exec app npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- All dependencies are properly available in the Docker environment

### ✅ Test Environment Configuration
- **Docker Environment**: Tests now run in proper Docker containers with correct environment variables
- **Database Connection**: Test database (db_unittest) is properly configured and running
- **Environment Variables**: APP_ENV=test properly set for test executions
- **Memory Limits**: Configured with `-d memory_limit=512M` for resource optimization

### ✅ Makefile Updates
Fixed all test-related commands in `/home/sme/p/timetracker/Makefile`:
- `make test`: Now uses development compose configuration with volume mounts
- `make test-parallel`: Fixed to use correct binaries and development environment
- `make coverage`: Updated to use proper Docker environment
- All commands now use `-f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml` for proper volume mounting

### ✅ Test Execution Results
**Full Test Suite**: 
- **362 tests, 3085 assertions** - All passing ✅
- **Execution time**: ~12 seconds
- **Memory usage**: ~105MB peak
- Only minor issues: 7 risky tests (exception handlers) and 1 deprecation warning

**Unit Test Suite**:
- **184 tests, 449 assertions** - All passing ✅  
- **Execution time**: ~2 seconds
- **Memory usage**: ~50MB peak
- Same minor issues: 7 risky tests

## Known Issues

### ⚠️ Parallel Test Execution
- **Database concurrency issues**: Multiple processes cause deadlocks and duplicate key violations
- **Root cause**: Test fixtures not properly isolated for parallel execution
- **Symptoms**: TRUNCATE/INSERT conflicts, lock timeouts, foreign key constraint violations
- **Recommendation**: Use single-threaded testing (`make test`) until database isolation is implemented

### ⚠️ Minor Quality Issues
- **7 risky tests**: EntrySaveDtoTest methods not properly cleaning up exception handlers
- **1 deprecation warning**: Non-critical, likely related to PHP 8.4 or Symfony framework
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only, all tests pass successfully

## Working Commands

### Primary Test Commands
```bash
# Full test suite (recommended)
make test

# Unit tests only (faster)
docker compose exec -e APP_ENV=test app ./bin/phpunit --testsuite=unit

# Coverage analysis
make coverage
```

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Install all dependencies
make install

# Individual installations
docker compose exec app composer install
docker compose exec app npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Alternative Direct Execution
```bash
# Using existing container (fastest)
docker compose exec -e APP_ENV=test app php -d memory_limit=512M ./bin/phpunit

# Using fresh container (clean environment)
docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml run --rm -e APP_ENV=test app php -d memory_limit=512M ./bin/phpunit
```

## Technical Details

### Docker Configuration
- **Base compose**: `compose.yml` (production-like services)
- **Dev overlay**: `compose.dev.yml` (development volume mounts)
- **Test database**: MariaDB with health checks and dedicated test data
- **Volume mounts**: Full project directory mounted in development containers

### File Paths
- **PHPUnit binary**: `./bin/phpunit` (project-specific)
- **Paratest binary**: `./bin/paratest` (for parallel execution)
- **Configuration**: `/var/www/html/phpunit.xml`
- **Test directory**: `/var/www/html/tests/`

### Environment Variables
- **APP_ENV=test**: Enables test-specific configuration
- **Memory limit**: 512M for PHPUnit execution
- **Database**: Connects to `db_unittest` container with test fixtures

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. **Fix parallel testing**: Implement proper database isolation (separate schemas or containers per process)
2. **Clean up risky tests**: Fix exception handler cleanup in EntrySaveDtoTest
3. **Address deprecation warning**: Update code for PHP 8.4 compatibility
4. **Monitor performance**: Current execution times are good, maintain optimization

## Summary

The Docker test environment is now **fully functional** with all 362 tests passing successfully. The setup provides proper isolation, correct environment configuration, and reliable execution through both Makefile commands and direct Docker execution. The only remaining issues are related to parallel execution optimization and minor code quality improvements that don't affect test reliability.
