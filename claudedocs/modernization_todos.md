# PHP 8.4 Modernization Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Core Type Safety with Enums ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] 1.1 Create UserType enum (ADMIN, PL, DEV, USER)
- [x] 1.2 Update User entity to use UserType enum
- [x] 1.3 Update BaseController user type methods
- [x] 1.4 Create EntryClass enum (PLAIN, DAYBREAK, PAUSE, OVERLAP)
- [x] 1.5 Update Entry entity to use EntryClass enum
- [x] 1.6 Create BillingType enum (NONE, TM, FP, MIXED)
- [x] 1.7 Update Project entity to use BillingType enum
- [x] 1.8 Create TicketSystemType enum (JIRA, OTRS)
- [x] 1.9 Update TicketSystem entity
- [x] 1.10 Create Period enum (DAY, WEEK, MONTH)
- [x] 1.11 Update repository classes

## Phase 2: Constructor Property Promotion ✅ ALREADY MODERN
- [x] 2.1 Service classes already use constructor promotion (e.g., ResponseFactory, QueryCacheService)
- [x] 2.2 Entity constructors not applicable (Doctrine entities)
- [x] 2.3 Controllers use dependency injection appropriately

## Phase 3: Readonly Conversions ✅ ALREADY MODERN  
- [x] 3.1 DTOs already use readonly classes (IdDto, EntrySaveDto, DatabaseResultDto)
- [x] 3.2 Value objects properly implemented with readonly pattern
- [x] 3.3 Response models properly structured

## Phase 4: Enhanced Type Declarations ✅ ALREADY MODERN
- [x] 4.1 Union types used throughout (int|float in TimeCalculationService)
- [x] 4.2 Modern nullable syntax used consistently
- [x] 4.3 Generic type hints implemented with docblocks

## Phase 5: Modern Patterns ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- [x] 5.1 Match expressions used (TimeCalculationService, enum methods, JsonResponse)
- [x] 5.2 Named arguments used appropriately in constructors
- [x] 5.3 Modern array handling patterns implemented

## Validation Steps (run after each phase)
- [ ] Run `composer test` (unit tests)
- [ ] Run `composer check-all` (quality checks)
- [ ] Run `composer analyze` (PHPStan analysis)
- [ ] Manual smoke testing
