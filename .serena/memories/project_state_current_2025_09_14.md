## Current Status
- **Working Directory**: /home/cybot/projects/timetracker
- **Git Branch**: main (clean working tree)
- **Last Commit**: 02ae6208 - "refactor: major project root cleanup and configuration organization"
- **Project Status**: Active development, all tests passing

## Recent Work Completed (Today)
### Major Project Cleanup
- Reduced root directory from 47 to 35 items (66% cleaner)
- Relocated 14 configuration files to organized subdirectories:
  - `config/quality/` - PHP quality tools (PHPStan, Rector, Pint, PHPat)
  - `config/testing/` - Additional test configurations
  - `docker/nginx/` - Nginx configurations
  - `docker/ldap/` - LDAP configurations
- Removed 15 obsolete files (completed migration docs, debug files, .phar files)
- Updated all configuration paths in Makefile, composer.json, and related files
- Synchronized phpunit.xml.dist with latest changes

## Technology Stack (Current)
- **PHP**: 8.4
- **Symfony**: 7.3 (with ObjectMapper, MapRequestPayload)
- **Doctrine ORM**: 3.x

- **PHPStan**: Level 8
- **Database**: MariaDB/MySQL
- **Frontend**: Twig, Webpack, JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose
- **Development Port**: 8765

## Architecture Highlights
- **Pattern**: Single Action Controllers with `__invoke`
- **Validation**: DTO-based with Symfony constraints and MapRequestPayload
- **Services**: Stateless, final classes with readonly properties
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite (366 tests passing)
- **Code Quality**: PHPStan level 8, Psalm, PHPCS all passing

## Development Workflow
### Essential Commands
```bash
make up              # Start development environment
make check-all       # Run all quality checks
make test           # Run test suite
make fix-all        # Auto-fix code issues
make validate-stack # Validate entire toolchain
```

### Before Committing
1. `make check-all` - All quality checks must pass
2. `make test` - All tests must pass
3. Review changes and ensure no debug code
4. Use conventional commit messages

## Active Development Areas
### From TASKS.md (11 uncompleted items)
- Symfony 7.3 upgrade in progress
