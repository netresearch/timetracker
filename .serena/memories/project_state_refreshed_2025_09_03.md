## Important Note About Serena Memories
Some memories like "recent_improvements" and "session_summary_2025_09_02" contain HISTORICAL information about work that has already been completed and committed. When using --refresh flag, we should:
1. Check actual current git status
2. Update memories to reflect current state
3. Not rely on outdated session memories for current status
