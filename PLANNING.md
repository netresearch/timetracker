# Upgrade Plan: Symfony 4.4 to 7.2

This document outlines the high-level plan for upgrading the application from Symfony 4.4 to Symfony 7.2.

## Overall Strategy

The upgrade will proceed incrementally through major LTS (Long-Term Support) versions to minimize risk and manage complexity:

1.  **Symfony 4.4 -> Symfony 5.4**
2.  **Symfony 5.4 -> Symfony 6.4**
3.  **Symfony 6.4 -> Symfony 7.2**

## Phases

Each major version upgrade will follow a similar pattern:

1.  **Preparation Phase (Current Version):**
    *   **Improve Test Coverage:** Add missing unit, integration, and functional tests.
    *   **Address Deprecations:** Identify and fix deprecations reported for the *next* major version using tools like the Symfony Deprecation Detector.
    *   **Refactor to Best Practices:** Ensure the codebase adheres to the best practices of the *current* Symfony version (e.g., directory structure, service configuration, annotations/attributes, removing legacy code).
    *   **Static Analysis & Code Standards:** Ensure code passes configured PHPStan/Psalm levels and adheres to PSR-12.

2.  **Upgrade Phase:**
    *   Update `composer.json` to the target Symfony version and related dependencies.
    *   Run `composer update`.
    *   Address immediate compatibility issues and errors arising from the update.
    *   Update configuration files (`services.yaml`, `routes.yaml`, `packages/`, etc.) as required by the new version.
    *   Consult the official Symfony Upgrade Guide for the target version.

3.  **Post-Upgrade Phase (New Version):**
    *   **Testing:** Run all tests (unit, integration, functional) to ensure application stability.
    *   **Manual Testing:** Perform thorough manual testing of critical application flows.
    *   **Documentation Update:** Update internal documentation (README, development setup, etc.) to reflect changes.

## Detailed Tasks

Specific, actionable tasks for each phase are detailed in `TASK.md`.
