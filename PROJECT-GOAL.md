# Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to incrementally upgrade the application from its current Symfony 4.4 version to the latest stable Long-Term Support (LTS) version, currently **Symfony 7.2**.

This upgrade aims to:

1.  **Leverage Modern Features:** Utilize the latest advancements in the Symfony framework and PHP language features (up to PHP 8.2+).
2.  **Improve Maintainability:** Enhance the codebase by adhering to current best practices, improving test coverage, and refactoring legacy patterns.
3.  **Enhance Security:** Benefit from the latest security patches and features provided by newer Symfony versions.
4.  **Ensure Long-Term Support:** Move to a version with active community and security support.
5.  **Boost Performance:** Take advantage of performance improvements introduced in newer framework versions.

The upgrade will be performed incrementally (4.4 -> 5.4 -> 6.4 -> 7.2) to manage complexity and risk effectively.
