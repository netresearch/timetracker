# ADR-001: PHP 8.4 and Symfony 7.3 Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-09-15  
**Deciders:** Architecture Team  

## Context

The TimeTracker application requires a robust backend framework capable of handling enterprise-grade time tracking functionality including LDAP authentication, JIRA integration, advanced reporting, and multi-tenant architecture. The team needed to select the foundational technology stack for the next major version.

### Requirements
- **Enterprise Integration**: LDAP/Active Directory, OAuth-based JIRA synchronization
- **Performance**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users with complex queries and reporting
- **Maintainability**: Strong typing, modern development practices, comprehensive testing
- **Security**: Role-based access control, secure token management, audit logging
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant support with performance isolation

### Alternatives Considered

1. **PHP 8.1/8.2 + Symfony 6.x**
   - Pros: More mature, wider adoption, extensive documentation
   - Cons: Missing modern PHP 8.4 features, approaching end-of-life support timeline

2. **PHP 8.4 + Laravel 11**
   - Pros: Rapid development, extensive ecosystem, built-in authentication
   - Cons: Less suitable for complex enterprise integrations, heavier ORM approach

3. **Node.js + Express/NestJS**
   - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem, high concurrency, microservices-friendly
   - Cons: Team expertise in PHP, existing LDAP/JIRA integration libraries

4. **Java + Spring Boot**
   - Pros: Enterprise-grade, excellent LDAP support, mature ecosystem
   - Cons: Higher resource usage, longer development cycles, team expertise gap

## Decision

We will use **PHP 8.4** with **Symfony 7.3** as the core technology stack.

### Key Factors

**PHP 8.4 Selection:**
- **Modern Language Features**: Named parameters, union types, attributes, enums provide better code expressiveness
- **Performance**: JIT compilation improvements, optimized garbage collection for long-running processes
- **Security**: Enhanced type safety, improved error handling, secure by default configurations
- **Long-term Support**: PHP 8.4 LTS ensures 3+ years of security updates
- **Team Expertise**: Existing PHP knowledge reduces learning curve and development time

**Symfony 7.3 Selection:**
- **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: Mature dependency injection, event system, security component
- **LDAP Integration**: Native LDAP component with Active Directory compatibility
- **API Development**: Excellent REST API support with serialization, validation, and documentation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing tools, database transaction handling
- **Performance Optimizations**: APCu caching, optimized routing, database query optimization
- **Security Framework**: Built-in CSRF protection, XSS prevention, secure session management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modern Development**: PHP 8.4 attributes eliminate annotation complexity, union types improve API design
- **Type Safety**: Strict typing reduces runtime errors, improves IDE support and refactoring
- **Performance**: 15-20% improvement over PHP 8.1, Symfony 7.3 optimizations for high-traffic applications
- **Ecosystem**: Access to latest Doctrine 3.x ORM features, modern testing tools
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, standardized project structure, extensive documentation

### Negative
- **Cutting Edge Risk**: Potential compatibility issues with some third-party packages
- **Migration Complexity**: Upgrading existing PHP 8.1 code requires careful planning
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs time to adopt PHP 8.4 features and Symfony 7.3 patterns
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Some packages may not immediately support PHP 8.4

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Adoption**: Implement new features in PHP 8.4 while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage to catch compatibility issues early
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Regular security updates and compatibility checks for all packages
- **Team Training**: Dedicated time for learning PHP 8.4 features and Symfony 7.3 best practices

### Technical Implementation
```php
// Configuration in composer.json
{
    "config": {
        "platform": {"php": "8.4"}
    },
    "require": {
        "php": "^8.4",
        "symfony/framework-bundle": "^7.3"
    }
}
```

### Performance Expectations
- **Response Time**: Sub-200ms for typical API endpoints
- **Throughput**: 1000+ requests/second with proper caching
- **Memory Usage**: ~128MB per PHP-FPM worker under normal load
- **Database Performance**: Complex reporting queries under 2 seconds

### Success Metrics
- Code maintainability score improvement by 25%
- 15% reduction in critical security vulnerabilities
- Developer productivity increase through modern tooling
- 20% performance improvement in API response times
