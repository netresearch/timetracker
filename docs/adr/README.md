# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document key technical decisions made for the TimeTracker project. Each ADR follows a standard format and captures the context, decision rationale, and consequences of important architectural choices.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this standard structure:

- **Status**: Current state (Proposed â†’ Accepted â†’ Deprecated â†’ Superseded)
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Background information and requirements that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural choice made and key implementation details
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts of the decision

## Decision Categories

### ðŸ”´ High Impact Decisions
- **Technology Stack**: Core framework and language selection
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication and authorization strategies  
- **Performance Architecture**: Database optimization and scaling decisions

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Impact Decisions  
- **Integration Patterns**: External system integration approaches
- **Caching Strategies**: Performance optimization through caching
- **API Design**: External interface design and versioning
- **Testing Approaches**: Quality assurance and testing methodologies

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Impact Decisions
- **Code Standards**: Style guides and formatting rules
- **Tooling Choices**: Development and deployment tool selection
- **Configuration Management**: Environment and deployment configuration

## Key Architectural Themes

### Enterprise Integration
- **LDAP/Active Directory** authentication with local fallback
- **JIRA OAuth 1.0a** integration for worklog synchronization
- **Multi-tenant** architecture supporting enterprise deployments

### Performance & Scalability
- **Multi-layer caching** (APCu â†’ Redis â†’ Database)
- **Database partitioning** and strategic indexing
- **Horizontal scaling** through stateless application design

### Developer Experience
- **Modern PHP 8.4** features and type safety
- **Comprehensive testing** with 80% coverage target
- **RESTful API** design with auto-generated documentation

### Security & Compliance  
- **Role-based access control** with fine-grained permissions
- **Encrypted token storage** and secure session management
- **Audit logging** for compliance and security monitoring

## Reviewing and Updating ADRs

### When to Create an ADR
- Significant architectural decisions affecting multiple components
- Technology selection with long-term impact
- Design patterns that will be used across the codebase
- Security or performance decisions with system-wide implications

### ADR Review Process
1. **Draft**: Create ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Team Review**: Architecture team reviews context and decision
3. **Stakeholder Input**: Relevant teams provide feedback
4. **Decision**: Mark as "Accepted" or return to draft
5. **Implementation**: Reference ADR during implementation
6. **Retrospective**: Review consequences after implementation

### Updating Existing ADRs

When architectural decisions change:

1. **Don't modify existing ADRs** - they are historical records
2. **Create new ADR** that references and supersedes the old one
3. **Update old ADR status** to "Superseded by ADR-XXX"
4. **Document migration path** from old to new approach

## Contributing

When proposing new ADRs:

1. Use the ADR template format consistently
2. Provide clear context and alternatives considered
3. Include implementation examples where helpful
4. Consider long-term maintenance implications
5. Get review from architecture team before marking as accepted
